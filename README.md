Bower package for jQuery UI Touch Punch by Dave Furfero http://furf.com/


## Why was this package created?
It seems like the other packages do not have a bower.json file, or have an old component.json file. Nor do they have version tags... This is the latest touch-punch from https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch to date. A list of dependencies are not included in the bower.json file as of yet, if you'd like to contribue by adding them feel free to create a pull request.
